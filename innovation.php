					We developed a special spheroidised heat treatment cycle to achieve an extra fine microstructure in our H11 and H13 steel, in spheroidised annealed condition. This results in export quality tough steel which conforms to GA/GA1 and GB/GB1 in VDEhSEP 1614 standard.

						The primary slag after melting the scrap contains many undesirable elements and inclusions. GSSL has developed a special in-house process such that primary slag is entirely removed from the molten scrap, before treatment in Ladle Refining Furnace and Vacuum Degasser. This results in very clean steel containing low S&P. Even Electric Arc Furnace(EAF) with Electric Bottom Tapping(EBT) will have some primary slag escaping during tapping, whereas our process guarantees 100% removal.

					At the outset, bot EAF and IF are used to melt steel scrap before it is refined. However, in contrast to EAF, IF uses no oxygen during melting. Consequently, there is scarcely any oxidisation of elements like Chromium and Manganese, resulting in a very low generation of inclusions both in quantity and variety. The complexities of inclusions' morphology and size even after the refining process is significantly less if IF is used. Surface defects like rokes, seams and cracks are observed to be much lesser with IF, which highly reduces chances of left over surface defects after conditioning. IF also allows for better recovery of expensive elements such as Ni, Mg, Cr and Mn, giving a cost benefit to the customer.

						An ingot's hot top quality determines the quality of a forging in terms of pipe, inclusions, centre looseness and internal soundness in general. We have developed a special Anti Piping Compound which, along with an excellent teeming practice, results in production of very high quality hot tops in our ingots. Along with significant quality improvements, this has also increased yield by 3%.

						Some grades of steel are of air hardening quality, which means that after austenitizing they can be quenched in air. In order ot achieve uniform hardness and mechanical properties from end-to-end, the cooling must be uniform throughout the bar. Our exclusively designed and constructed air hardening facility ensures uniform hardness and mechanical properties in our air hardened steel.

						A combination of innovative processes such as 100% primary slag removal, optimum slag basicity for high inclusion absorption capacity, excellent deoxidation, effective vacuum degassing, proper soft rinsing, a well designed argon shroud, and an excellent teeming practice ensure production of very clean steel at GSSL. Such steel gives better lifetime and performance of components, and is popular in Oil and Gas field, Nuclear industry, Stainless Steel applications, and Tool Steel applications .
